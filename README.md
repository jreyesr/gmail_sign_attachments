# Automatic Attachment Signatures for Gmail

This Chrome extension automatically adds digital signatures to email attachments on the form of text files.

The use of digital signatures on attachments *should* guarantee the provenance of files: if a file is alleged to have been generated by the email's owner, it should have a valid digital signature file to accompany it. If a file is alleged to come from the email's owner but does NOT have a signature, it should be considered of completely unknown provenance and treated accordingly. In other words, only files with a VALID signature are to be trusted as the True Word of the email account's owner.
