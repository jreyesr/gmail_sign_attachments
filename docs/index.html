  File & Signature

<div id="status"></div>
<div id="valid_message" style="display: none;">
  This signature is valid!

  What does this mean?

  <ul>
    <li>The file <span class="filename"></span> was created by A B</li>
    <li>The file hasn't been modified by anyone <i>at all</i> after being sent by A B</li>
  </ul>

  Therefore, you can treat the file <span class="filename"></span> as the True Voice of A B
</div>
<div id="invalid_message" style="display: none;">
  This signature is NOT valid!

  What does this mean?

  Either:
  <ul>
    <li>The file <span class="filename"></span>  was not created by A B,</li>
    <li>The file or the signature were modified by someone after being sent by A B, or</li>
    <li>The file or the signature were corrupted during download</li>
  </ul>

  In any case, you should NOT assume that the file <span class="filename"></span> comes from A B.
  Nothing can be guaranteed about the origin of the file.
